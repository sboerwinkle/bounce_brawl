The one I love, for being an inspiration and better than she knows and always there for me.
Simon Boerwinkle, for hard work and dedication. This game wouldn't have been possible without him, by which I mean me.
All of my brothers, for play testing a game which wasn't that good at the time. No guarantees even now :)
Zachary Harrison, for being way too enthusiastic.
Adam Bliss, who named the <F6> cheat.
Whoever makes "Cyanide and Happiness", for inspiring Adam Bliss.
A. Schiffler, for making a neat font and releasing it under the zlib license.
SiegeLord, for their article on circle drawing in OpenGL.
Kirby Jennings, for being a random guy I met in high school. I have no idea what happened to him. I salute you, Kirby.
If I haven't mentioned you yet and you know you deserve to be mentioned, I apologize for my poor memory. You too.
Everyone else, for populating the world which has shaped me to such a large degree.
